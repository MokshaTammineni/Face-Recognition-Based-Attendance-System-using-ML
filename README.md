# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-using-ML
This project presents a face recognition and attendance marking system using machine learning techniques. The system employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for accurate face recognition. This system is capable of detecting and recognizing faces, marking attendance, and storing it in a log file.
